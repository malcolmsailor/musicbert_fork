<!-- TODO 2024-04-03  -->
A fork of MusicBERT <!-- TODO 2024-04-04 link --> for token classification for Roman Numeral analysis and other music theory tasks

The main differences are:
- freezable version for fine-tuning
- implementing token classification (both single- and multi-task) that is used for key and roman numeral prediction.

# Roadmap

- clean out misc_scripts
1. Oct repr and `write-seqs` code
2. Add evaluation code
3. Implement HF port
